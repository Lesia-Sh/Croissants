      Culinary legends Stories of how the Kipferl — and so, ultimately, the
      croissant — was created are widespread and persistent culinary legends,
      going back to the 19th century. However, there are no contemporary sources
      for any of these stories, and an aristocratic writer, writing in 1799,
      does not mention the Kipferl in a long and extensive list of breakfast
      foods.
